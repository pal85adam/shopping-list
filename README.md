# Shopping List Project

## Specification


### Project Brief

#### These are the minimum features the web application needs in order to be considered complete:

‣ Develop it with either pure JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular or Vue.

‣ Allow to write a task by adding an item name and price. Example: "VÖXLOV", "755:-".

‣ Allow to mark a shopping item as completed/acquired.

‣ Allow to view completed/acquired shopping items.

‣ We would like that the users can close and reopen the page without losing their list.

‣ Can work from any mobile web browser without installing anything from the app store.

#### Extras

‣ Host the web application so we can access from the web.

‣ Allow to drag a picture to each shopping list item. And store it on a cloud platform.

‣ How to we avoid users making their own list slow, by uploading images that are too big?

‣ Make the visual design look as similar as possible to our website [Resources folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/735jiu66x32w13c/AACcDmI1z_W2fw467noYXW4sa?dl=0).
